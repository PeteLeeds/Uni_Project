  <p>Thank you for taking the time to participate in my study!</p>

  <p>First of all, please read the <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8gancEPvLR52qxxYRbrFMrOV5hLdSrq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103707490864920827696&rtpof=true&sd=true>Participant Information Sheet</a> and sign the <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfp3vrsaLLsqfpnRoA9uW4KDGEqnlnT2I9hSZgDxT7Wk4OZ2A/viewform?usp=sf_link>Consent Form</a>. Once you have completed the form you will be given a unique code. <b>Please keep a record of this code for the second form, as you will not be shown it again.</b></p>

  <p>Second, please download <a href="https://github.com/PeteLeeds/Uni_Project/raw/main/Mario.jar">this .jar file</a> and run (click on) it (you may need to install <a href=https://www.java.com/en/download/>Java</a> if you do not already have it installed). Please play the five levels displayed in order. You can play each level as many times as you like, and there is a practise level ('test') available to allow you to familiarise yourself with the controls.</p>

  <p>Finally, complete <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIAXpbpmD7eNnpI4nvH9MzOQ0O64L1qkyMBgj1hkkd2SJzaQ/viewform?usp=sf_link>this Google Form</a> ranking the levels from the most difficult to the least.</p>
  
  <p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
